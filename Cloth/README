This folder contains 4 modules, all written in Python 2.7.9:
draw_window.py : This is the one that should be run
particle.py : Particle Class
spring_force.py : Spring Force Class
cloth.py : Cloth Simulation Class, has code for all the steps in the simulation, including integration methods

Also contained demo videos:
assignment2_1.m4v
assignment2_2.m4v
assignment2_3.m4v

There is also a detailed report MiniProject2Report.pdf with explanations and observations.

To run this, the following packages are needed:
PyQt4, PyOpenGL and numpy

These can all be installed either using homebrew or pip. Pip will not work for PyQt, which needs to be downloaded and compiled.
Basically these final packages need to be installed in the correct Python version's 'site-packages' folder.

To edit the code:
Probably the only useful parts to tweak are in draw_window and cloth.
In draw_window.py:
1. self.myCloth = ClothSim(100, 10, 2.5, self.dt) can be edited to change the mass which is currently 2.5(see ClothSim class for parameters)
2. self.myCloth.simulation_step(1) can be called with 0 for euler integration, 1 for semi implicit and 2 for verlet. Note: This exists in both paintGL() and draw_stuff() and both must be changed.

In cloth.py:
Where the spring forces are being added in createLayout(), the parameters can be changed to change ks and kd
Eg here :
self.forces.append(Spring(self.particles[i][j], self.particles[i][j + 1], 10.0, 6.0))
